  Becoming a vendor/sponsor at Chow Down/ Street Kitchen Food Festival provides you with the opportunity to market your products/food and/or services to our participants in an exciting, and fun environment. We will provide you with a 10x10 space in a prime location at our event where you can post signage, hand out swag, and talk to thousands of people. <br>
Below are a few of our vendor package options. However, we love working through trades and cross promotions. If you have something to offer in exchange for a vendor package (ex: Promotional support, etc.) please feel free to pitch the idea to us.
